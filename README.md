# Mortgage Calculator

A project idea from https://www.codementor.io/ to allow users to find out the monthly repayments for a mortgage.

## Features

- Use the input slider to set your house price, down payment, repayment time and interest rate
- See your loan amount and estimated monthly payments


## Tech Stack

- React.js: Front-end library for building user interfaces, allowing developers to create reusable UI components and manage state efficiently.
- SASS: Preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS, providing features like variables, nested rules, and mixins to make CSS more maintainable and extendable.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, offering features like type checking, interfaces, and advanced tooling to improve code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity.


## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies: npm install
- Start the development server: npm start
- Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
